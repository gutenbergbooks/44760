<h2>"BRAINS FOR CASH."</h2>

<p class="center">["The unbridled greediness of some
authors."&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Gosse.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Publisher</i> (<i>nervously</i>). And
what will your terms be for a
short story, in your best style?</p>

<p><i>Author</i> (<i>loftily</i>). I have only
one style, and that is perfection.
I couldn't think of charging less
than fifty guineas a page.</p>

<p><i>Publisher</i> (<i>aghast</i>). Fifty
guineas a page! But are you
aware that Lord <span class="sc">Macaulay</span> got
only ten thousand for the whole of
his history, and that <span class="sc">Milton</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Author</i> (<i>rudely</i>). Hang <span class="sc">Macaulay</span>
and <span class="sc">Milton</span>! Surely you
would not compare those second-rate
writers with <i>myself!</i> If
<i>they</i> were content to work for
starvation wages, I am not.</p>

<p><i>Publisher</i>. But, say your story
runs to twenty pages, as it probably
will, I shall have to pay
you for that one short tale the
really ridiculous sum of a thousand
pounds!</p>

<p><i>Author</i> (<i>coolly</i>). Yes, it is rather
ridiculous&mdash;ridiculously small, I
mean. Still, out of regard to your
pocket, I am willing to accept
that inadequate remuneration. Is
it a bargain?</p>

<p><i>Publisher</i> (<i>with a groan</i>). It
must be. The public demands
your work, and we have no option.
But allow me to remark that your
policy is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Author</i> (<i>gaily</i>). A Policy of Assurance,
on which <i>you</i> have to pay
the premium. Ha, ha!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Year Or Two Later.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Author</span> (<span class="sc">deferentially</span>). I have
a really capital idea for a work of
fiction, on a subject which I believe
to be quite original. What&mdash;ahem!&mdash;are
you prepared to
offer for the copyright?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Couldn't think of
making an offer till we saw the
work. It might turn out to be
worth nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Author.</i> Nothing at all! But
you forget how my fame&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Disappeared when
we were obliged to charge the
public six shillings for a story of
yours about the size of an average
tract. Other writers have come
to the front, you know. Still, if
there's anything in your novel,
when it's finished, we should, I
daresay, be prepared to offer you
a couple of guineas down, and a
couple more when&mdash;say&mdash;a thousand
copies had been sold. Is it
a bargain?</p>

<p><i>Author</i> (<i>sadly</i>). I suppose it
must be! Yet I can hardly be
said to be <i>paid</i> for my work.</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Perhaps not. But
you can be said to be <i>paid out!</i></p>

<p>What pitfalls where the dazzled eye</p>
<p class="i2">Sees doubly ruddy light!</p>
<p>For in the season, just in May,</p>
<p class="i2">When many meetings meet,</p>
<p>The jocund vestry starts away,</p>
<p class="i2">And closes all the street.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The shut-up streets of London!</p>
<p class="i2">How willingly one jumps</p>
<p>From where one's cab must stop, through pools</p>
<p class="i2">Of mud, in dancing pumps!</p>
<p>When thus one skips on miry ways</p>
<p class="i2">One's pride is much decreased,</p>
<p>Like <i>Mrs. Gilpin's</i>, for one's "chaise"</p>

<p class="i2">Long, long, in vestry hall,</p>

<p>And green for ever be the men</p>
<p class="i2">Who spend the rates in May,</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Second Man.</i> It's the finest drink in the world. I never touch

<p>"But must I give up this comfortable furniture?" asked the
poor person, looking at the venerable chairs, some of which were
distinctly rickety.</p>

<p>"You must, indeed," replied firmly, but still with a certain tenderness,
the stern official.</p>

<p>"But I can <i>nearly</i> hear what they are saying," urged the fair
petitioner.</p>

<p>"I cannot help it."</p>

<p>"And <i>all</i> but see them," and once again she peered through the grille.</p>

<p>"I am forced to obey my orders," returned the official. "You
applauded. You clapped your hands&mdash;and you must retire."</p>

<p>"And for that little burst of enthusiasm," almost wept the
person, "I am to lose all this happiness! To be stopped from hearing
an indistinct murmur, seeing a blurred picture, resting on rickety
seats, and breathing a vitiated atmosphere! Am I to lose <i>all</i> these
comforts and pleasures and advantages?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," was the answer. And then the official opened
the door of the Ladies' Gallery of the House of Commons, and the
person passed out.</p>

<p>Anyone arriving at Burlington House so early as to be the first person to pay
his money and take his choice, will probably look straight before him, and will
feel somewhat confused at seeing in the distance, but exactly opposite him, a
dignified figure wearing a chain of office, politely rising to receive the early
visitor. "It can be no other than the President himself," will at once occur to
the stranger within the gates; "and yet, did I not hear that he was abroad for
the benefit of his health?" Then, just as he is about to bow his acknowledgments
of the courtesy extended to him personally by the Chief Representative
of Art in this country, he will notice seated, at the President's left hand, and
staring at him, with a pen in his hand, ready either to take down the name of
the visitor, or to make a sketch of him, a gentleman in whose lineaments anyone
having the pleasure of being personally acquainted with Mr. <span class="sc">Stacy
Marks</span>,
R.A., would at once recognise those of that distinguished humourist in
bird-painting.
"Is there wisions about?" will the puzzled visitor quote to himself,
and then boldly advancing, hat in hand, to be soon replaced on head, he will
come face to face with the biggest picture in the Academy, covering almost the
entire wall.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/220-i-400.png"><img src="images/220-i-200.png" width="200" height="306" alt="No. 277. The G. O. M. at Cannes." /></a>
<p>No. 277. The G. O. M. at Cannes. By T. Graham.</p></div>

<p>The stately figure is not Sir <span class="sc">Frederic Leighton, P.R.A.</span>, who
unfortunately has been compelled to go abroad for the benefit of his
health&mdash;<i>prosit!</i>&mdash;nor is
the seated figure Mr. <span class="sc">S. Marks</span>; but the former is "<i>The Bürgermeister of
Landsberg, Bavaria</i>," and the latter is his secretary, while the other
figures, all likenesses, are "his Town Council" in solemn deliberative assembly. The picture,
an admirable one, and, as will be pretty generally admitted, a masterpiece of
the master's, is No. 436 in the book, the work of Meister <span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer,
R.A.</span></p>

<p>But as this is in Gallery No. VI., and as it is not every one who will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
privileged to see the picture as the early bird has seen it, and as
some few others may, perhaps, see it during the season, this
Representative retraces his steps from No. VI., and commences
<i>de novo</i> with No. 1.</p>

<p>No. 17. "<i>Finan Haddie</i>," fresh as ever, caught by <span class="sc">J. C. Hook,
R.A.</span> Title, of course, should have been "<i>Finan Haddie Hook'd</i>."</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">John Millais'</span> <i>St. Stephen</i> (<i>not</i> a parliamentary
subject),
showing that Good Sir <span class="sc">John's</span> hand has lost none of its cunning,
is No. 18; and after bowing politely to Mrs. <span class="sc">Johnson-Ferguson</span>,
and pausing before this charming picture by <span class="sc">Luke Fildes, R.A.</span>, to
take a last Luke at her, you will pass on, please, to No. 25, "<i>The
Fisherman and the Jin</i>," and will wonder why <span class="sc">Val. C. Prinsep, R.A.</span>,
spells the cordial spirit with a "J" instead of a "G." It is a
spirited composition.</p>

<p>No. 31. Mr. <span class="sc">John S. Sargent, A.</span>, let "<i>Mrs. Ernest Hills</i>" go out
of his studio in a hurry. She is evidently "to be finished in his next."</p>

<p>No. 34. "<i>A Quiet Rehearsal.</i>" Lady Amateur all alone, book in
hand, to which she is not referring, trying to remember her part and
say it off by heart. It is by <span class="sc">W. B. Richmond, A.</span> To quote a cigarette
paper, this work may be fairly entitled "A Richmond Gem."</p>

<p>No. 43. "<i>Evening.</i>" By <span class="sc">B. W. Leader</span>, A. Delightful.
Artistic aspirants in this line cannot play a better game than that of
"Follow my Leader."</p>

<p>This Representative recognised "<i>Dr. Jameson, C.B.</i>," by
<span class="sc">Herkomer</span>, at a glance. If you are asked by anyone to look at
"<i>Hay Boat</i>" do not correct him and say "You mean <i>A</i> Boat,"
or you will find yourself in the wrong boat, but admire <span class="sc">Hilda
Montalba's</span> painting, and pass on to <span class="sc">Ouless, R.A.</span>'s, excellent
portrait of "<i>J. J. Aubertin</i>" (a compound name, whose first two
syllables suggest delightful music while the last syllable means
money); thence welcome our old friend <span class="sc">Frith, R.A.</span>, who, in 67, [and
a trifle over, eh?] shows us "<i>Mrs. Gresham and Her Little Daughter</i>."
From the "little D.'s" expressive face may be gathered that she
has just received a "Gresham Lecture." After noting No. 73 and 83
(the unhappily separated twins) together, you may look on No. 126.
Two fierce animals deer-stalking in a wild mountainous region,
painted by <i>Arthur Wardle</i>. Only from what coign of vantage did
Mr. <span class="sc">Wardle</span>, the artist, make this life-like sketch? However, he
came out of the difficulty safe and sound, and we are as glad to
welcome a "<i>Wardle</i>" as we should be to see his ancient associate
"<i>Pickwick</i>," or a "<i>Weller</i>," in Burlington House.</p>

<p>No. 139. Charming is Sir F. <span class="sc">Leighton's</span> "<i>Fair One with the
Golden Locks</i>." To complete the picture the hairdresser should have
been thrown in. She is <i>en peignoir</i>, and evidently awaiting his visit.
This is the key to these locks.</p>

<p>No. 242. Mr. <span class="sc">Andrew C. Gow, R.A.</span>, gives us <span class="sc">Buonaparte</span> riding
on the sands with a party of officers, "1805." The Emperor is cantering
ahead of the staff. Another title might be "<i>Going Nap at Boulogne</i>."</p>

<p>No. 160. "<i>A Lion Tamer's Private Rehearsal.</i>" But <span class="sc">Briton
Rivière, R.A.</span>, calls it "<i>Ph&oelig;bus Apollo</i>."</p>

<p>No. 251. Queer incident in the life of a respectable middle-aged
gentleman. Like <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>, he has mistaken his room in the hotel,
and has gone to bed. Suddenly, lady, in brilliant diamond tiara, returns
from ball, and finds him there. The noise she makes in opening the
curtains awakes him. He starts up alarmed. "Hallo!" he cries, and
for the moment the ballad of "<i>Margaret's Grim Ghosts</i>" recurs to
his mind. His next thought is, "How fortunate I went to bed in my
copper-coloured pyjamas, with a red cummerbund round me." Of
course he apologised, and withdrew. What happened subsequently
is not revealed by the artist who has so admirably depicted this
effective scene, and whose name is Sir <span class="sc">John Millais</span>, Bart., R.A.</p>

<p>No. 368. Excellent likeness, by Mr. <i>Arthur S. Cope</i>, of the well-known
and popular parson <span class="sc">Rogers</span>. <i>A Parsona Grata</i>. This
typical old-fashioned English clergyman, who, in ordinary ministerial
functions, would be the very last person to be associated with a
"chasuble," will henceforth never be dissociated from a "<span class="sc">Cope</span>."</p>

<p>No. 491. A picture by Mr. <span class="sc">Fred Roe</span>. If <span class="sc">Nelson's</span> enemies had
only known of this incident in his lifetime!! Here is our great
naval hero, evidently "half seas over," being personally conducted
through some by-streets of Portsmouth, on his way back to the
<i>Victory</i>, in order to avoid the crowd. Rather a hard <span class="sc">Roe</span>, this.</p>

<p>No. 767. Congratulations to <span class="sc">T. B. Kennington</span> on his "<i>Alderman
George Doughty, J.P.</i>," or, as the name might be from the characteristic
colouring, Alderman <span class="sc">Deorge Gouhty</span>, which is quite in
keeping with the proverbial aldermanic tradition.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Little Mixed.</span>&mdash;In its account of the private view at the Royal

pink, and a picture hat trimmed with pink roses." This is presumably
the result of the influence of Mr. <span class="sc">Horsley</span>. But isn't it
going a little too far, at least to begin with? A piece of sculpture&mdash;say,
a Venus&mdash;in a harmonious costume of striped black and pink
might pass. But the addition of a picture hat trimmed with pink
roses is surely fatal.</p>

<h2>AT THE BANQUET, SATURDAY, MAY 4.</h2>

<p>Chair of absent President ably filled by Sir <span class="sc">John Millais</span>, who,
pluckily struggling against evidently painful hoarseness, made, in
returning thanks, an exceptionally graceful, touching, and altogether
memorable speech. Odd to note that, had Sir <span class="sc">John</span>, speaking
hoarsely, broken down, we should have heard his <i>remplaçant</i>
Horsley speaking. <i>The</i> incident, however, which will mark this
banquet as unique in Academical records, was Sir <span class="sc">John's</span> mistaking
one Archbishop for the other, and, in consequence, pleasantly indicating
by a polite bow to the prelate on his left, that he called upon
<i>him</i>, the Archbishop of <span class="sc">York</span>, to reply for the visitors.
"<span class="sc">York</span>,
you're wanted," said, in effect, the genial Sir <span class="sc">John</span>, utterly ignoring
the presence of His Grace of <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>. Whereupon, <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>
collapsed, while the Northern Primate, vainly attempting to
dissemble his delight, professed his utter surprise, his total unpreparedness,
and straightforth hastened to improve the occasion. But
before fifty words had passed the jubilant Prelate's lips, Sir <span class="sc">John</span>,
having discovered his mistake, rose quickly in his stirrups, so to
speak, and pulled up the impetuous <span class="sc">York</span> just then getting into his
stride. Genially beaming on the slighted <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>, Sir <span class="sc">John</span>
called on "The Primate of All England" (a snub this for <span class="sc">York</span>) to
return thanks. "One Archbishop very like another Archbishop,"
chuckled the unabashed Sir <span class="sc">John</span> to himself, as he resumed his seat,
"but quite forgot that <span class="sc">York</span> as Chaplain to Academy is 'His Grace
<i>before</i> dinner,' and <span class="sc">Canterbury</span> represents 'Grace <i>after</i>
dinner.'"
"'Twas ever thus," muttered <span class="sc">York</span>, moodily eyeing the last drop in
his champagne-glass, as he mentally recalled ancient ecclesiastical
quarrels between the two provinces, from which the Southern Prelate
had issued victorious. <span class="sc">Canterbury</span> flattered, but, fluttered, lost
his chance. His Royal Highness's speech brief, comprehensive,
effective. Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> entertaining. "The rest is silence," or
better if it had been. No more at present. Good luck to the
Academy Show of 1895.</p>

<h3>THE UP-TO-DATE DUCKLINGS.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>A Fable.</i>)</p>

<p>A Duck that had lately succeeded in hatching
a fine brood of ducklings, and was much
concerned on the point of their polite education,
took them down to the river one day in
order to teach them to swim.</p>

<p>"See, my dears!" she said when they were
all got to the bank, addressing her brood in
encouraging accents, "this is the way to do
it," and so saying the old duck pushed off
from the land, in evident expectation that
her young ones would follow her.</p>

<p>The Ducklings, however, instead of coming
after their mother, remained on the bank, talking
and laughing and whispering among themselves
in a very knowing manner; until at
last the old bird, provoked by their levity and
wondering what ailed them, called out sharply
to them from mid-stream to come into the
water at once; upon which one of the Ducklings,
who had evidently been constituted
spokesman for the rest, made bold to address
his mother in the following words.</p>

<p>"You must be a simpleton indeed, Madam,"
said he, "to imagine that we are going to do
anything so foolish as to endanger our lives in
the reckless fashion in which you are now exposing
yours; for though it may be true that
in obedience to some unwritten law of nature
(unknown at present to us) you are floating
securely upon the surface of the stream, instead
of sinking to the bottom of it, yet it by
no means follows from thence that we should
do the same thing, supposing we were so foolish
as to follow your example. Rest assured, dear
Madam," continued the Duckling, "that so
soon as we have sifted this matter to the
bottom for ourselves, we shall act on the knowledge
of it, according as our experience may
suggest to us; but for the present, at any rate,
we prefer to remain where we are."</p>

<p>And so saying, the Duckling, accompanied
by the rest of the brood, turned his back on
his natural element, and returned forthwith
to the poultry-yard.</p>

Hyperborean Enthusiast.</i>)</p>

<h3><span class="sc">No. IV.&mdash;Signs and Wonders.</span></h3>

<p>I sat on the beach one forenoon in midsummer. A great number
of people were doing much the same. The rhapsodists and orators,
the blameless Ethiopians with their barbaric instruments of music,
the itinerant magicians with their wands, the statuesque groups
posed before the tripod of the photographer, the snow-white sea-chariots
with crimson wheels, the bare-legged riders on antique
steeds, made me fancy I was gazing at a scene of Southern Hellenic
life. Why I know not&mdash;for it was not in the least like.</p>

<p>Then I saw an enormous black hand stretch down over the fjord.
I was not alarmed, for I am becoming accustomed to apparitions of
this kind.</p>

<p>It set weird signs and black marks upon the railings of the jetty,
and on the white sides of the bathing machines, and on the sails of
the fishing-boats, and when I turned about, the parade itself
was plastered with tablets.</p>

<p>And on all things had the New Lawgiver incised in letters of gold
and azure and purple upon shining tables the new commandments:<br />
"Use Skäuerskjin's Soap!"; "Try Tommeliden Tonic!"; "Buy
Boömpvig's Pills!"; "Ask for Baldersen's Hairwash!"</p>

<p>And I heard the voice of the wild waves saying, as they lapped up
over the cheap sandshoes and saturated paper bags full of gingerbread
nuts:</p>

<p>"This is the new moral law. That men should cherish the outside
and insides of their bodies, and keep them clean, like precious
vessels of brass and copper. Rather to let the picturesque perish
than forget for a moment which is the best soap for the complexion,
and which will not wash clothes. Never to see a ship spreading her
canvas like a sea bird without associations of a Purifying Saline
Draught or a Relishing Pickle. To ask and see that ye procure!"</p>

<p>Then I looked into the heavens above me, and behold, high above
the esplanade hung a hand, enormous as the one that had set its
marks on everything below, but white, white; and it held a brush
and wrote until the sky was full of signs, and they had form and
colour, but not of this world, and those who ran could read them.</p>

<p>And I bought a shell-box and a bath bun, and closed my eyes, and
lay musing in an agony of soul. Suddenly I felt the pain snap, and
something grow in me, and I saw in my soul's dawning the great
half-opened shell of a strange oyster.</p>

<p>And this oyster has its bed on my very heart, and it is <i>my</i> salt
tears that nourish it, and it grows <i>inside</i>, invisible to all but me.</p>

<p>But I know that, when the oyster opens, I shall find within its
shell, like a gleaming dove-coloured pearl, the great Panacea of the
To Be; and, if you ask me to explain my meaning more fully, I
reply that the bearings of this blind allegory lie in the application
thereof, and that ye are a blow-fly brood of dull-witted hucksters.</p>

<h2>FROM CORINTO TO HERNE BAY.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>An Anglo-Nicaraguan Parallel.</i>)</p>

<p>The young Midshipman looked towards
Corinto. The public buildings were still
within range of the monster guns. The select
army of one hundred and fifty had retired
before the advance of the blue jackets and
marines. All was tranquil, and, as he gazed
upon the Nicaraguan capital, his eyes closed,
and he dreamed a dream.</p>

<p>He was once more in England. He was at
the seaside. Here in front of him were
bathing-machines. There, to his right, was
a circulating library. He could see a clock-tower
and a shortened pier. Then he laughed
in his glee. He was at Herne Bay! Close
to the Isle of Thanet&mdash;within sight of the
Reculvers!</p>

<p>He had scarcely realised his happiness, when
he noticed on the ocean a flotilla. Three
gigantic ironclads were approaching the
tranquil town!</p>

<p>"The Nicaraguan fleet!" he murmured in
his sleep.</p>

<p>It, alas! was too true! The Central
American Admiral had sent an ultimatum. The
news had run from one end of Herne Bay to the
other that, unless the sum demanded were
paid at once, the as-yet-unconquered watering-place
would be "ploughed," as the Poet
<span class="sc">Bunn</span> would have put it, "by the hoof of the
ruthless invader."</p>

<p>Then there was a hurried consultation.
What could be done with that overpowering
fleet? It was useless to defend the bathing-machines;
the donkeys and their drivers were
no match for heavy ordnance. What could
the few coast-guardsmen do when threatened
by five hundred Nicaraguans?</p>

<p>"Herne Bay must surrender!" murmured
the Midshipman in his sleep. "There is no
help for it."</p>

<p>And then came a strange sight. The
search-lights of the Nicaraguan fleet played
upon the sea front, and the little garrison of
Herne Bay retired towards Birchington and
Margate. The Band (lent from the Militia)
marched away, followed by the heavy cavalry
of the bathers, and the Uhlan-like donkeys
of the sands. The representatives of the Navy
(carrying their look-out telescopes) brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>Then, when all had gone, the sailors and
marines of the Nicaraguan fleet landed. The
British flag was hauled down, and replaced
by the colours of the enemy.</p>

<p>Herne Bay was conquered!</p>

<p>At this point the Midshipman awoke with
a start. He looked round, and sighed a great
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"How fortunate it is that the English fleet
have conquered Corinto and not the Nicaraguan
fleet Herne Bay!" he cried in an
ecstacy of patriotic fervour. Then he performed
for hours the duties of his command.
Towards the close of day he again casually
glanced at Corinto and once more was involuntarily
reminded of Herne Bay. And as
he gazed upon the Central American town he
came to the conclusion that it was about as
formidable and about as well defended as the
Kentish watering-place. And having arrived
at this opinion he determined in his own mind
that the taking of Corinto, as a feat of arms,
was scarcely on a par with the Victory of
Trafalgar.</p>

<h2>NEW GALLERY QUERIES.</h2>

<p>Is Mr. <span class="sc">Hitchcock's</span> "<i>Flight
into Egypt</i>" a view of Dartmoor?
and what are all those blue
flowers? Borage, blue currants,
corn-flowers, "new broom," gorse
dyed blue for this occasion only,
or what? I have been offered all
these random suggestions by distinguished
critics, but they somehow
don't seem convincing.</p>

<p>Why are the competitors in the
charming swimming-match between
Mermaids and Tritons so
remarkably <i>dry</i> in the upper
parts? I always get decidedly
damp when I enter the sea, but
these ladies take to it like ducks&mdash;"<i>Dux
f&oelig;mina facti</i>" (as said an
ancient poet in anticipation)&mdash;and
so I suppose the water rolls off
their backs.</p>

<p>Will "<i>Her First Offering</i>" of
grass and daisies go far towards
softening the heart of a statuette?
Her sister, last year, had a much
more tempting "<i>Gift for the
Gods</i>," but there is no accounting
for divinities' tastes.</p>

<p>What does Mr. <span class="sc">Kpoffnh</span>&mdash;dear
me, I can <i>not</i> get his name right?&mdash;mean
by "<i>Sous les Arbres?</i>"
Is it a man or a statue, a spook or
a symbol? Why does he wear a
marble wig? Why does his brown
hair show underneath it? Why
has he got a wall eye? Why is he
"under the trees?" Why is he
at large at all? Why&mdash;&mdash; But
there, I give it up! I don't believe
there are any answers to
these conundrums!</p>

<p>How is it I've been looking at
"<i>Kit</i>" for two whole minutes
before realising that there's a
Persian cat in the composition? But
she's a real beauty, when you <i>do</i>
coax her out of this "puzzle
picture."</p>

<p>Why (this is no new query!)
have Sir <span class="sc">Edward Burne-Jones'</span>
Luciferians and Sleeping Beauties
and peeresses and children and
brides one and all the same world-weary
expression? Why do they,
without exception, look as if they
were off to a funeral, or had just
seen themselves in the glass? Are
there no other colours in the land
but dull green, steel-blue, ink-purple,
and brick-red? Why do
I immediately want to commit
suicide after studying these masterpieces?
Why doesn't Psyche
cheer up a bit, even though she
<i>is</i> going to be married? <i>She</i>
wasn't a <ins title="Greek: nea gunê"><i>&nu;&#8051;&alpha; &gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&#8053;</i></ins>, I'm sure!</p>

<p>Why does the dog in Mr. <span class="sc">Holman
Hunt's</span> picture look as if it
had softening of the brain? and
why do I pass on hurriedly to the
next picture?</p>

<p>Will Miss <span class="sc">Rehan's</span> left shoulder
hold up her dress much longer,
I wonder, in Mr. <span class="sc">Sargent's</span> portrait?
I don't know, but I <i>have</i>
fears!</p>

<p>Is the lady in Mrs. <span class="sc">Swynnerton's</span>
"<i>Sense of Sight</i>" preparing
to catch a cricket ball, or cutting
an acquaintance, or going to recite
something? I <i>should</i> like to
know.</p>

<p>Why couldn't some enterprising
dentist supply the ladies in
"<i>Echoes</i>" with false teeth, and
why weren't they taken away
quietly home, and not allowed to
exhibit their other anatomical
innovations? Echo answers to
these and all my queries, "Why,
indeed?"</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 29.</i>&mdash;When <i>Mr. Toots</i>, in
agony of perturbed bashfulness, sat down on <i>Florence Dombey's</i>
best bonnet, he murmured, "Oh, it's of no consequence." <span class="sc">Squire
of Malwood</span> does not resemble <i>Mr. Toots</i> in any respect, not even
that of bashfulness. But he has a way, when taking important
move, of studiously investing it with appearance of "no consequence."
Thus to-night, asking for lion's share of time for remaining
portion of Session, he could hardly bring himself to uplift
his voice: mumbled over phrases; coughed at conjunctions; half
paralysed by prepositions; looked round with pained astonishment
when Members behind cried, "Speak up!" Why should he trouble
to speak up on so immaterial a matter? Still, to oblige, he would
say all he wanted was to take for Government purposes, for rest
of Session, all the time of House, save the inconvenient Wednesday
afternoon sitting, and the inconsiderable Friday night.</p>

<p>More marked this cultured mannerism when announcing immediate
introduction of Bill prohibiting plural voting. This a genuine
surprise. Not been talked of since House met. Nobody thinking of
it. <span class="sc">Squire</span> in almost whisper announced its introduction to-morrow.
Astonished beyond measure at commotion created; the boisterous
cheers of Liberals, the uneasy laughter of Opposition.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable place this House of Commons," he said afterwards,
gazing over my head into the infinite horizon, where shadowy
figure of Local Veto Bill is visible to the eye of faith. "Always full
of surprises even for old practitioners like you and me."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, much relishing this subtle humour, was himself
in sprightliest mood. The whole business of Session, he protested,
was an elaborate joke. If they were there to work, he would take
off his coat and ding on with the best of them. But they were there
to play. "Well, let us play," he said, holding out both hands with
gesture of invitation to Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>Proposal irresistible. House divided forthwith; <span class="sc">Squire's</span> motion
carried by majority of 22; then, whilst half a dozen naval
men talked water-tube boiler, <span class="sc">Prince Arthur, Squire of Malwood</span>,
and picked company from either side went out behind
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair to play. Such larks! To see <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> take
in a stride "the backs" given him by the <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>,
with <span class="sc">Cawmel-Bannerman</span> next; to see <span class="sc">John Morley</span> seriously
whipping a top; to watch <span class="sc">Bryce</span> breathless behind the nimble
hoop; to look on while <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span>, forgetful of China and
Japan, thinking nothing of Nicaragua, played a game of marbles
with <span class="sc">Hart Dyke</span>; to see <span class="sc">Lockwood</span> trying a spurt with <span class="sc">Dick
Webster</span>, the course being twice round the Division Lobby,
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>, fresh from the Cab-arbitration, having handicapped them&mdash;to
see this, and much else, was a spectacle wholesome for those
engaged in it, interesting for the solitary spectator.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Shipbuilding Vote in Navy Estimates agreed to.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Odd thing that on this particular night, when
Government bring in Bill prohibiting plurality of voting, <span class="sc">Bill</span>
should bring in a Bill. His first and only Bill. Of course he might
argue if we have one man one vote, one <span class="sc">Bill</span> one Bill is all
right. Yes; but, as <span class="sc">Sark</span> with his keen mathematical instinct
points out, this is a case of two Bills&mdash;<span class="sc">Bill</span>, the Member for Leek,
and a Bill to empower magistrates to prohibit the sale of intoxicating
liquors to persons previously convicted of drunkenness. That is
obviously a plurality of Bills. But we are getting hopelessly mixed.
The only man among us who sees clear is <span class="sc">John William</span>. Deep
pathos in his voice as he says the time is near at hand when a tyrannical
Government will attempt to enforce principle of "One Man
One Drink."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/228-650.png"><img src="images/228-250.png" width="250" height="400" alt="Cap'en Tommy Bowles." /></a>
<p class="center">Cap'en Tommy Bowles.</p></div>

<p>Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> had best of dreary evening. Mentioned
yesterday, with tears from his honest blue eyes coursing down his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
rugged, weather-beaten cheek, fresh infamy
on part of <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>. Had announced
on Thursday that, at Monday's
sitting, Naval Works Loan Bill would be
proceeded with. <span class="sc">Tommy</span> accordingly clewed
up, and ran for port; laying to for forty-eight
hours, prepared speech on Naval Works.
Now <span class="sc">Squire</span> calmly announced that Shipbuilding
Vote was to be taken. What was
<span class="sc">Tommy</span> to do with speech prepared on Naval
Works Loans?</p>

<p>In despair yesterday; to-day bright idea
struck him. <span class="sc">Shaw-Lefevre</span> had moved to
introduce One Man One Vote Bill. Why
shouldn't <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, flying that flag, run in and
deliver his speech on Naval Works? A bold
experiment; only hope of success was that
House, being in almost comatose state,
wouldn't notice ruse if cleverly managed.
Trust <span class="sc">Tommy</span> for clever management. Holding
sheaf of notes firmly in left hand, deftly
turning them over with the hook that serves
him for right hand, the old salt read his
speech on Naval Works Loan Bill. Here and
there, when he observed restless movement in
any part of House, fired off phrase about
"forty-shilling freeholder," "occupation
votes," "rural constituencies," "re-distribution,"
"country going to the dogs,"
"jerrymandering," and "right hon. gentleman
opposite." Scheme worked admirably;
speech reeled off, and <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood's</span>
knavish trick confounded.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;One Man One Vote Bill
brought in.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;House not to be moved to evidence of excitement even
by prospect of Budget night. On such occasion in ordinary times
attendance at prayer-time most encouraging to Chaplain. Begins to
think that at last his ministrations are bearing fruit. This afternoon
congregation not much above average. No rush for tickets for seats.
When <i>Squire</i> rose to open his statement, great gaps below Gangway
on Ministerial side. The <span class="sc">Squire</span>, recognising situation, refrained
from heroics, content to deliver plain business speech. No exordium;
no peroration; no flight into empyrean heights of eloquence as was
the wont of Mr. G. Some sympathetic movement when <span class="sc">Squire</span>, with
momentarily increased briskness of manner, spoke of snap of cold
weather in February, with its accompaniment of influenza, increased
death-rate, and fuller flow of death duties into
National coffers. The quality of this mercy
was not quite unstrained. Not dropping, like
the gentle dew from heaven, till February, increased
death rates will not come into account
till succeeding year. Still, there was rum. As
thermometer fell rum went up with a rush.</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.</p>
<p>High ho! and a bottle of rum.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>What with comforting the mourners, and
imbibed as a preventive, rum brought a
windfall of £100,000 into the Treasury.</p>

<p>That was well in its way. But then there
were those 75,000 mean-spirited people who
ought to have died last year, their estates
paying tribute to <span class="sc">Chancellor of Exchequer</span>,
and who positively insisted upon living. The
long-trained fortitude of the <span class="sc">Squire</span> nearly
broke down when he mentioned this circumstance.
Pretty to see how it also touched
<span class="sc">Jokim</span>. The wounds of riven friendship temporarily
closed up; the rivalry of recent years
forgotten in contemplation of these 75,000
reckless, ruthless people, who, in defiance of
law of average, didn't die in financial year
ending March 31, 1895. The past <span class="sc">Chancellor
of Exchequer</span> and his successor in office
mingled their tears. But for intervention of
table they would probably have flung themselves
into each other's arms and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"Thus," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, himself not
unaffected by the scene, "doth one touch of
nature make Chancellors of the Exchequer

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget brought in.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> submitted proposal to dock
payment of £10,000 annuity to Duke of <span class="sc">Coburg</span>. Thinks H.R.H.
might, in circumstances, get along nicely without it. <span class="sc">Sage Of
Queen Anne's Gate</span> agrees. <span class="sc">T. H. Boltonparty</span>, on the other hand,
gravely differs. Folding his arms as was his wont on eve of
Austerlitz, he regards <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> with awful frown.
Imperial instincts naturally wounded. "No trifling with the personal
revenues of our Royal cousins, whether at home or abroad,"
said <span class="sc">T. H. Boltonparty</span> in the voice of thunder that once reverberated
across the shivering chasms of the Alps.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Proposal to cut off Duke of <span class="sc">Coburg's</span> pension
negatived by 193 votes against 72.</p>

<h2>TWO WAYS OF DOING IT.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">First Way.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Representative of Her Britannic Majesty's Government to
the &mdash;&mdash; Minister for Foreign Affairs.</i></p>

<p class="rindent"><i>January 1, 18-0.</i></p>

<p>I have the honour to inform your Excellency that I am instructed
by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that Her Britannic
Majesty's Government has reason to complain of the conduct of the
Government of which your Excellency is the representative. I have
the honour to say that it will be advisable for your Excellency to urge
upon the Government of which your Excellency is the representative
the necessity of inquiry into the matter as speedily as possible. I
have further the honour to add that it will be gratifying to Her
Britannic Majesty's Government if the Government of which your
Excellency is a representative will give the matter to which I refer
the earliest attention.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Representative, &amp;c., to the &mdash;&mdash; Minister, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="rindent"><i>January 1, 18-1.</i></p>

<p>I have the honour to call the attention of your Excellency to the
long and unsatisfactory correspondence that has passed during the
last year between your Excellency as representing the Government
of which you are the representative and the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs upon the matter of the despatch I had the honour to
forward to your Excellency dated January 1, 18-0. I am directed to
have the honour of requesting your Excellency to urge upon the
Government of which your Excellency is a representative the necessity
of a speedy settlement of the matter in dispute.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Representative, &amp;c., to the &mdash;&mdash; Minister, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="rindent"><i>January 1, 18-2.</i></p>

<p>I have again the honour to call the attention of your Excellency
to, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<blockquote><p>
(<i>Rather longer than the foregoing one. Then follow two more
"from the same to the same" in 18-3 and 18-4. This is the
first way.</i>)
</p></blockquote>

<h3>SECOND (AND SHORTER) WAY.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From British Admiral to &mdash;&mdash; Minister.</i></p>

<p class="rindent"><i>January 1, 18-5</i>, 12 <span class="sc">Noon</span>.</p>

<p>If you don't pay up within a quarter of an hour, I will bombard
your capital, seize your country, and imprison the Government of
which you are the representative.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From &mdash;&mdash; Minister, &amp;c., to British Admiral.</i></p>

<p class="rindent"><i>January 1, 18-5</i>, 12.10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Don't fire. Have sent money demanded by P.O.O.</p>
